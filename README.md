# CryptographyGame


This project represents a cryptogram game embedded within a web server, all written in the C programming language. It comprises a C file along with a text file. The operational flow of the project is as follows:
The user executes the program with the path to the file in a specific folder to provide web server functionalities for that file. The fundamental aim of this project is to fetch a random quote from the quotes.txt file and apply the Fisher-Yates algorithm to shuffle it. Subsequently, the user engages in deciphering this shuffled puzzle. For instance, when the user inputs "AB," the web server identifies the "AB" segment in the URL, replaces the letter "A" with the letter "B," and allows the user to continue playing until successfully deciphering the quote. Upon successful completion of the puzzle, a congratulatory message is displayed on the web page. Additionally, the user has the option to commence a new game at their discretion. This program incorporates various data structures and functions such as linked lists, structs, and multithreading. 

Considering that C stands as one of the foundational low-level languages in the realm of software development, , creating such a project was initially challenging. Nevertheless, this endeavor significantly expanded my understanding of web servers, file handling operations, and memory management. I am fully confident that I can write different projects using the C language right now!
